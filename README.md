# OhNoBot
This is a bot for a roblox game called Blockate.

Uses program-ab for chatbot, and aspose ocr for image reading. With the aspose ocr trial lisences, you must add random letters at the end of the message to make it read the whole thing.

Default cmd prompter is '-'

The higher level cmds and blacklist/unblacklist/lame are all team/world specific, so make sure to change those.

idk dont be cringe with this
